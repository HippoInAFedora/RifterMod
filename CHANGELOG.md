# ChangeLog

ver 0.0.3
- Got rid of my lazy implementation of passives that aren't showing up anyways (they were breaking things, apparently (hopefully))


ver 0.0.2
- I intended to add basic vfx for visual clarity. I am leaving that for later (if you want to do this, let me know!)
- Made it so other skills cannot be used during Recursion.
- Fixed Rift Rider getting cancelled by everything.
- >buffs/nerfs
- primary buffed from 450% to 550%
- Refraction buffed from 375% to 475% (I'm too lazy to change the logic right now, so I'm testing this first)
- Recursion charge-up time has been increased from .5s to .8s.


ver 0.0.1
- Initial build
