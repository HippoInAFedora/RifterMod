# Rifter v0.0.2

Adds Rifter, a positional-based character that utilizes sweet-spots and teleportation to deal massive damage.
This is a pre-alpha build, mostly for playtesting. Download a HitBoxViewer Mod, otherwise you won't see a thing.

So what's the build?

## Passives:

> Rift/Fracture

Your shots consist of Rifts and Fracture Lines. Rift are sweet-spot damage at the end of your shot. Primary and Secondary shots are connected by weaker Fracture Lines that deal 100% damage that are unable to activate item effects. Rifts are weakened if they hit the ground before max distance.

> Overcharge

Overcharge teleports enemies hit by a skill to your far-range rifts.

## Utilities:

> Slipstream

Teleport a short distance, briefly turning invulnerable. Your next shot is *overcharged*.

Travel through your primary rift, dealing 100% damage. Hit enemies are teleported to your previous location.

## Special

*note*: the first rift starts at 200% damage and a radius of 10m. Subsequent rifts are 20% stronger and larger than the last.

# Ending Notes

Discord is pending. If you have any issues, let me know in the Ideas - Rifter tab for now. That'll change in the future.

I have a lot of people to thank for helping me. I'll keep it vague till later on so I don't have to keep updating this part.
